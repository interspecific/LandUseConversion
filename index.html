<!-- Panel for About -->
<div class="panel">

  <h4>Methods and Sources</h4>
  <p>The values used in this tool are derived from a combination of peer-reviewed research and government databases and reports.</p>
 
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carbon Sequestration:</strong> 
      Estimates are based on data from authoritative sources like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provide information on the carbon sequestration potential of various ecosystems. Tropical forests, for example, can sequester up to 120 tonnes of carbon per hectare in vegetation alone, making them one of the most effective natural carbon sinks. Wetlands, on the other hand, are exceptionally effective in soil carbon storage, holding up to 643 tonnes per hectare of soil carbon, nearly six times more than tropical forests. Forests globally absorb approximately 15.6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, about 40% of global CO2 emissions, underscoring their critical role in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong> The calculation for carbon sequestration is based on the following formula:
      <br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
        <strong>Total Carbon Sequestration</strong> = <strong>Sequestration Rate</strong> × <strong>Area</strong>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      Here, the <strong>Sequestration Rate</strong> is the amount of carbon sequestered per hectare per year, specific to the ecosystem type, and the <strong>Area</strong> is the size of the land in hectares. The tool multiplies these rates by the area of the land to estimate the total carbon sequestration over a given period.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Stormwater Retention:</strong> 
      The tool incorporates hydrological data from studies on green infrastructure, which demonstrate the effectiveness of natural landscapes in managing stormwater. Green infrastructure, including urban wetlands, permeable pavements, and rain gardens, can significantly reduce stormwater runoff, improve water quality, and mitigate flooding risks in urban areas. For instance, wetlands can retain up to 1,500 cubic meters of stormwater per hectare per year, compared to just 50 cubic meters for bare soil and 400 cubic meters for grass lawns. In urban settings, green infrastructure is crucial for managing the challenges posed by increased impervious surfaces, which exacerbate stormwater runoff and pollution.
      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong> The stormwater retention calculation is based on the following formula:
      <br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
        <strong>Total Stormwater Retention</strong> = <strong>Retention Rate</strong> × <strong>Area</strong>
      </div>
      <br><br>
      Here, the <strong>Retention Rate</strong> is the volume of stormwater retained per hectare per year for a given land use type, and the <strong>Area</strong> is the size of the land in hectares. The tool calculates the total stormwater retention by multiplying these rates by the area under consideration.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Habitat Quality and Biodiversity:</strong> 
      Habitat quality scores are informed by ecological research that evaluates the impact of different land uses on biodiversity. Natural habitats, such as forests and wetlands, play a vital role in supporting diverse plant and animal species, essential for maintaining ecosystem resilience. Converting degraded or underutilized land to natural habitats can lead to significant improvements in biodiversity. Reforestation and wetland restoration projects not only increase carbon sequestration but also enhance habitat quality, supporting a wider range of species and promoting ecosystem health.
      
      <br><br>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong> Habitat quality is quantified using the following formula:
      <br><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
        <strong>Habitat Quality Score</strong> = <strong>Baseline Score</strong> + (<strong>Land Use Change Factor</strong> × <strong>Area</strong>)
      </div>
      <br><br>
      The <strong>Baseline Score</strong> represents the initial habitat quality before any land use changes, and the <strong>Land Use Change Factor</strong> reflects the potential improvement or degradation due to the change. The tool evaluates how changes in land use can either improve or degrade habitat quality by applying a score to each land use type, based on ecological studies.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Context and Importance</h4>
  <p>As the world grapples with the issues of climate change, habitat and biodiversity loss, and environmental contamination, the way we use and manage land has become critically important. Urbanization, deforestation, and the conversion of natural landscapes into agricultural or developed land are major drivers of greenhouse gas emissions, loss of ecosystems, and poor environmental quality.</p>
  
  <p>This tool serves as a practical method to address these issues. By converting underutilized or degraded land into more sustainable uses—such as reforestation, wetland restoration, or the creation of urban green spaces—communities can:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mitigate Climate Change:</strong> 
      Land conversion to forested areas or wetlands can significantly increase carbon sequestration, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Reforestation efforts in tropical regions can sequester up to 40.7 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year during the first 20 years of growth, making it a highly effective strategy for climate change mitigation. Wetlands also play a crucial role in carbon sequestration, particularly in their soil, which holds significantly more carbon than other ecosystems.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Improve Environmental Quality:</strong> 
      Green spaces act as natural filters, improving air and water quality, reducing urban heat islands, and managing stormwater runoff more effectively. In urban environments, green infrastructure such as permeable pavements and rain gardens can reduce stormwater runoff by increasing infiltration, thereby reducing the burden on stormwater systems and improving water quality. These practices not only manage water more effectively but also enhance the aesthetic and recreational value of urban spaces.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Increase Habitat and Promote Biodiversity:</strong> 
      Restoring natural habitats supports a wide range of plant and animal species, promoting biodiversity and increasing the resilience of ecosystems. Reforestation not only sequesters carbon but also restores habitats for wildlife, enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. Urban green spaces and restored natural areas can also provide critical habitat for species in increasingly fragmented landscapes, helping to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on biodiversity.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Enhance Community Well-being:</strong> 
      Access to green spaces and natural areas is linked to improved mental and physical health, offering recreational opportunities and enhancing the quality of life in urban environments. Green spaces provide essential services, including temperature regulation, air purification, and social cohesion, all of which contribute to the well-being of urban residents. The presence of natural areas within cities can also foster a greater connection to nature among residents, encouraging stewardship and sustainable behavior, which are critical for long-term environmental sustainability.
      <br><br>

      Are you considering the logging of a woodlot to turn it into agricultural land? Use this tool to evaluate the environmental trade-offs. Discover how much carbon will be lost in the process and how much stormwater retention will be reduced, potentially leading to increased local erosion and flood risks.
      <br><br>    
    </li>

    <li><strong>Explore the benefits of environmental restoration projects</strong>  
      Are you involved in environmental restoration or curious about the benefits of such projects? This tool helps quantify how reforestation, wetland restoration, or the creation of urban green spaces contribute to positive environmental outcomes, including stormwater management, biodiversity improvement, and carbon sequestration.
      <br><br>    
    </li>

    <li><strong>Evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of landscaping choices</strong>  
      Are you planning a landscaping project and want to ensure that your choices will support sustainability? Use this tool to compare how different types of land use—whether it’s a garden, a prairie, or a grass lawn—will influence carbon storage, water retention, and habitat quality.
      <br><br>    
    </li>

    <li><strong>Plan for climate change mitigation</strong>  
      Are you part of a local government or conservation group interested in reducing the impacts of climate change in your area? This tool helps calculate how land use changes, such as converting bare soil to wetlands or urban areas to green spaces, can increase carbon sequestration and reduce the urban heat island effect, contributing to climate resilience.
      <br><br>    
    </li>

    <li><strong>Assess the long-term impact of weakened wetland regulations</strong>  
      Recent changes to Indiana’s wetland regulations, including Senate Bill 389, have significantly reduced protections for state-isolated wetlands, allowing developers more freedom to impact these crucial ecosystems without sufficient mitigation. Under the revised rules, wetlands that were previously protected under the Clean Water Act and the Indiana Wetlands Program by IDEM (Indiana Department of Environmental Management) no longer have the same level of protection. This weakening of wetland regulations not only puts wetlands at risk but also shifts the cost of flooding onto private landowners and local municipalities. With fewer requirements for stormwater management and mitigation, local governments may face increased financial burdens to address flood risks. This tool can help assess the impact of these regulatory changes on carbon sequestration, stormwater retention, and overall ecosystem health, providing critical data for understanding the long-term consequences of reduced wetland protections.

  <h4>IPCC Statistics</h4>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Global Carbon Budget:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>To limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world has a remaining carbon budget of approximately 420 gigatonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) as of 2018. Exceeding this budget increases the risk of severe climate impacts, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events, sea level rise, and ecosystem loss.</li>
            <li>The carbon budget for a 2°C warming limit is slightly larger, around 580 GtCO2, but even this threshold poses significant risks, especially for vulnerable communities and ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Land Degradation and Human Impacts:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Human activities, including agriculture, deforestation, and urbanization, have already caused significant land degradation, affecting nearly 25% of the Earth's ice-free land area. This degradation leads to reduced productivity, biodiversity loss, and diminished ecosystem services, further exacerbating climate change.</li>
            <li>Land degradation contributes to the loss of 23% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU). The restoration of degraded lands is therefore critical for reducing emissions and enhancing carbon sinks.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Biodiversity Loss and Species Extinction:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Since 1900, human activities have led to a rapid acceleration in species extinction rates, with current extinction rates estimated to be tens to hundreds of times higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years. Approximately 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, if current trends continue.</li>
            <li>Insects, which play critical roles in pollination, nutrient cycling, and as a food source for other species, are particularly vulnerable. Studies indicate that 40% of insect species are at risk of extinction over the next few decades due to habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and overuse of pesticides.</li>
            <li>Future projections suggest that continued biodiversity loss could result in the collapse of ecosystems that are vital for human survival, such as those providing food, clean water, and air. The loss of biodiversity also undermines the resilience of ecosystems, reducing their ability to adapt to climate change.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Role of Forests and Wetlands in Carbon Sequestration:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Forests globally absorb about 15.6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, which is equivalent to around 40% of global CO2 emissions. This makes forest conservation and reforestation key strategies for climate mitigation.</li>
            <li>Wetlands, which store up to 643 tonnes of carbon per hectare in their soil, are among the most effective natural carbon sinks. Protecting existing wetlands and restoring degraded ones are vital actions for maintaining their carbon storage capacity.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Climate Mitigation through Sustainable Land Management:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, improved crop and livestock management, and soil carbon sequestration, can contribute to reducing emissions while enhancing food security and resilience to climate impacts.</li>
            <li>The IPCC emphasizes the importance of integrating land management with broader climate strategies, such as reducing deforestation, promoting reforestation, and enhancing soil carbon storage, to achieve significant and lasting climate benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Water Resources and Climate Change:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Climate change is intensifying the global water cycle, leading to more extreme weather events, including floods and droughts. These changes are expected to exacerbate water scarcity, particularly in regions that are already vulnerable.</li>
            <li>Integrated water management approaches that consider the interconnections between water, land, and ecosystems are essential for ensuring sustainable water use and resilience in the face of climate change.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Economic and Social Impacts of Climate Change:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The economic costs of inaction on climate change are projected to be significant, with potential GDP losses of up to 10% by the end of the century if global warming exceeds 2°C. These costs arise from damages to infrastructure, health impacts, loss of productivity, and the need for adaptation measures.</li>
            <li>Investing in climate mitigation now, including through sustainable land use practices, is far more cost-effective than the long-term economic disruptions that unchecked climate change would cause.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
